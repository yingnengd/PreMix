# MCP Auto Mix Engine — v1.1 Scope

## What v1.1 IS

- Bus-based auto mix correction
- Section-aware (Region / Marker / A-B)
- Stability-controlled responsibility
- Plugin-agnostic rule system
- No timeline writing

## What v1.1 is NOT

- No fade / envelope
- No volume riding
- No clip gain writing
- No ML-based song form detection
- No creative decision making

## Key Improvements from v1.0

- Responsibility is no longer static
- Chorus / Verse behavior differs naturally
- No oscillation or jitter
- Fully compatible with existing templates

## Frozen Interfaces

- mcp_roles.lua
- mcp_fix_rules.lua (plugin-agnostic)
- mcp_section_detector.lua
- mcp_stability.lua

Any new feature must:
1. Not break v1.1 behavior
2. Be optional
3. Respect bus-first philosophy
